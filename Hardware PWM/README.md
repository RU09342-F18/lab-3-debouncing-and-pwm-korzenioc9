# Hardware PWM
The code in this section of the lab increments the pulse width of an LED in the same manner as the software PWM section (50% initial, incremented by 10%, reset once at 100% and button is pressed), except that this time hardware on the boards is used instead of software. Setting the timers into reset, set, or toggle mode is where the hardware comes into play. This simplifies the code a bit allowing us to only have to write some capture compare register values. Both boards will increment an LED brightness and have a separate LED blink every time the button is pressed to confirm PWM change. Both boards are implemented in the same way with the exception of port/pin numbers, and a timer discrepency that will be covered below.

## MSP430FR2311
The most significant difference between the implementation of this board and the G2553 is the use of a timer B module as this processor does not contain a timer A. This requires some different nomenclature in the coding, but the timers on both boards function more or less the same.
